    <string name="content">Hi, this is a new Netology! Once upon a time, Netology began with online marketing intensive courses. Then there were courses in design, development, analytics and management. We grow ourselves and help students grow: from beginners to confident professionals. But the most important thing remains with us: we believe that everyone already has the power that makes them want more, aim higher, run faster. Our mission is to help us embark on the path of growth and start a chain of change. http://netolo.gy/fyb</string>
